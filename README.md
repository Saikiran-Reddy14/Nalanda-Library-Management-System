# Nalanda Library Management System

This is a backend system for a library management platform built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The system includes user management, book management, borrowing/returning books, and generating reports such as the most borrowed books and active members.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with roles (Admin, Member)
- **Book Management**: CRUD operations for books (only accessible by Admins)
- **Borrowing System**: Members can borrow and return books
- **Reports**: Admins can view statistics such as the most borrowed books and active members

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB (Ensure MongoDB is running on your machine or accessible remotely)

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following environment variables:
MONGO_URI: Your MongoDB connection URI.
JWT_SECRET: A secret string used for generating JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).
PORT=8000

git clone https://github.com/Saikiran-Reddy14/Nalanda-Library-Management-System.git
cd nalanda-library-management-system

Install dependencies:
npm install

### Running the Application
Make sure MongoDB is running.
